Build a RESTful API sample using Node.js in JavaScript and MySQL
============
## setup by the commands below #
1. Installation from package.json
> npm install
* we will use "mysql", "express", "body-parse", "esm", "nodemon", "node-dev"
2. or you can also use <u><i>npm i PACKAGES -D</i></u> to install them for development manually
3. Test the code
> npm run test
* the test script uses package node-dev to watch the code continoualy in modification, and package esm to compile ES6 JavaScript
> npm run dev
* or you can run the code once using node or nodemon
